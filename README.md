# NoSQL-socialNetworkAPI

  ## Description

  This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database, and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) ODM. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
